# Radio Group

## Pattern Usage

A radio group is a set of checkable buttons, known as radio buttons, where no more than one button can be checked at a time. Selecting one automatically deselects any previously selected button.

## Keyboard Interaction

| Key                          | Function                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Tab`                        | Moves focus into the radio group. Focus lands on the checked button, or the first button if none is checked. |
| `Shift + Tab`                | Moves focus out of the radio group.                                                                          |
| `Right Arrow` / `Down Arrow` | Moves focus to and checks the next radio button. Wraps from last to first.                                   |
| `Left Arrow` / `Up Arrow`    | Moves focus to and checks the previous radio button. Wraps from first to last.                               |
| `Space`                      | If focused radio button is not checked, checks it.                                                           |

**Note on toolbar context:** When a radio group is inside a toolbar, arrow keys move focus but don't change which button is checked. `Space` or `Enter` is required to check a button.
