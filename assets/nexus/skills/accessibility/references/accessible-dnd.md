# Accessible Drag and Drop: Guidelines & Best Practices

## Core Principle

Every drag-and-drop interaction must have an equivalent keyboard-only and screen-reader-accessible path. Mouse-based drag is the enhancement, not the baseline.

Follow the patterns reference for any ARIA components such as menu, slider, listbox, etc. `skills/accessibility/references/aria-apg-patterns-reference.md`

## The 5 Patterns

### 1. Interact with a Canvas (Move & Resize)

Move or resize objects freely on a 2D grid.

| Input        | Interaction                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mouse**    | Click and drag the item to move; drag the corner handle to resize                                                                  |
| **Keyboard** | Press Spacebar on the **Move** / **Resize** button to enter that mode, arrow keys to adjust, Spacebar to confirm, Escape to cancel |

- Not all corners of a rectangular object need to be grabbable for keyboard users. Default to the bottom right corner, but adjust as requested.

### 2. Resize in One Dimension

Resize a table column width.

| Input        | Interaction                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mouse**    | Drag the column divider handle                                                              |
| **Keyboard** | Use a hidden slider from the APG (accessible via assistive tech) with Left/Right arrow keys |

### 3. Move Between Lists (Kanban)

Transfer items across categorized columns.

| Input        | Interaction                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mouse**    | Drag items from one column and drop on another                                                                                                                    |
| **Keyboard** | Press spacebar on a **Move** button, arrow keys to move up and down within the same list, and left right to adjacent lists. Spacebar to confirm, Escape to cancel |
| **Keyboard** | Press the item's **Move** button to open a menu of destination lists, arrow keys to select, Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel                                    |

### 4. Move from one list to another

Reorder items within a grid-based sortable list.

| Input        | Interaction                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mouse**    | Click and drag to reorder                                                                                                                             |
| **Keyboard** | Navigate to an item, Spacebar to grab, Up/Down or Left/Right (depending on list orientation) arrows to reposition, Spacebar to drop, Escape to cancel |

### 5. Sort a Listbox

Reorder options inside a `role="listbox"`.

| Input        | Interaction                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mouse**    | Click to drag and drop between locations                                                                                |
| **Keyboard** | Arrow keys to focus an option, Spacebar to toggle drag-drop mode, arrows to reorder, Spacebar to drop, escape to cancel |

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### Aria Live Regions for Real-Time Feedback

- Use a single, visually hidden `<span>` with `aria-live="assertive"` to announce every state change: grabbed, moved, dropped, cancelled.
- Announce **position context** (e.g., _"Item grabbed. Current position in list: 3 of 7"_, _"Object location at 3,2 on the canvas"_).
- Announce **boundaries** (e.g., _"Reached left edge of canvas"_).
- Provide distinct messages for **grab**, **move**, **drop**, and **cancel** actions.

### Keyboard Interaction Model

- **Spacebar** is the universal grab/drop toggle across most patterns.
- **Arrow keys** are used for repositioning while in drag mode.
- **Escape** always cancels and reverts to the previous state.
- **Tab** is trapped during drag mode to prevent focus from leaving the dragged item.
- Provide hidden instructions via `aria-describedby` to the trigger button for move or resize (e.g., _"Press spacebar to grab and re-order"_).

### Semantic HTML & ARIA

- Use `role="listbox"` and `role="option"` with `aria-selected` for sortable listboxes.
- Use `aria-describedby` to link items to their interaction instructions.
- Use `aria-label` and a generic aria `role` for canvas regions (e.g., _"Canvas: 20 by 20"_).
- Visually hide instructions with `sr-only` while keeping them available to screen readers.

### Visual State Indicators

- Apply CSS classes for **grabbed**, **moving**, and **resizing** states.
- Reduce opacity of the original item during mouse drag, following rules for Non-Text Contrast so that these states are visible for users with low vision.
- Highlight drop targets during `dragenter` and remove on `dragleave`.

### Focus Management

- Return focus to the moved element after a keyboard-driven move completes.
- In Kanban, after moving a card to a new column, focus is programmatically set to the card's button in its new location.
- Listbox options manage focus via `tabIndex={0 | -1}` and `componentDidUpdate` auto-focus.

### Cancelability

- Store the previous state before any grab operation.
- **Escape** always restores the original state and announces _"Re-order cancelled"_ or _"Move cancelled"_.

### Alternative Controls for Complex Actions

- When drag-and-drop crosses containers (Kanban), provide a **menu button** as an alternative (not just keyboard shortcuts on the item itself).
- For resize, provide an ARIA `slider` as a fully accessible markup of the visual drag handle.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Every mouse drag operation has an equivalent keyboard flow
- [ ] a centralized region using `aria-live="assertive"` announces all state transitions
- [ ] Grab/drop/cancel messages include positional context
- [ ] Spacebar toggles grab, arrows reposition, Escape cancels
- [ ] Focus is managed correctly after every operation
- [ ] Hidden instructions describe the keyboard interaction model
- [ ] Visual indicators reflect grabbed/moving/resizing states
- [ ] Previous state is stored so Escape can fully revert
- [ ] Alternative controls (menus, slider) exist for cross-container or resize operations
